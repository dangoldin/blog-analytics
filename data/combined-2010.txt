I will try a new policy - at least one post a week. Harass me if I'm not doing it.
According to this  blog post   Google  gives their emplo﻿yees $1 a day to advertise on Google. The intent is to give employees the perspective of an Adwords user in order to improve the product. In addition to giving employees exposure to Adwords, this also has potential to increase the competition in  Adword  auctions by causing bids to increase and leading to more revenue  for Google. Given that Google has more than 10,000 employees worldwide this can have an effect on smaller advertisers.     Other people have written about Google advertising for their own products and giving employees free money can have a similar, although smaller, effect.
