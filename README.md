# Blog Analysis

I run a Jekyll blog at [http://dangoldin.com](http://dangoldin.com) and have been blogging actively since 2013 and this is my attempt to track and analyze my writing over time.

The Python scripts goes through the entire directory and the R script provides some visualization.

```
python analyze.py ~/code/blog.dangoldin.com/_posts /tmp/out.csv text
```
